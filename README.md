KandyPSTN
=========

KandyPSTN is a tiny App developed using HTML, JqueryUI and Javascript. The App heavily relies on the Kandy Javascript SDK. We are going to leverage the power of Kandy API for making public switched telephone network (PSTN) calls.

Let to give you a brief idea about PSTN vs VOIP. The PSTN calls go through circuit switching. It's all physical circuits. It's being used from many years and even today. When you establish a phone or landline call, it's where the PSTN comes into picture. A dedicated connection gets established between the two callers and all communication goes through analog signals as opposed to digital in case of VOIP.

Here's what our App does. We are going to manage user contacts in browser local storage and by using Kandy Javascript SDK, we will initiate a call.
